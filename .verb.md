## What is nanomatch?

Nanomatch is a fast and accurate glob matcher with full support for standard Bash glob features, including the following "metacharacters": `*`, `**`, `?` and `[...]`. 

See the [features section](#features) for more info about features.

**How is this different from [micromatch][]?**

Nanomatch only provides wildcard matching, which represents only 1 of the 5 matching "types" offered by micromatch. The others are listed in the [features](#features) section.

Nanomatch will also provide the wildcard matching functionality to micromatch, starting with v3.0.0. 

## Getting started

```js
var nanomatch = require('{%= name %}');

// the main export is a function that takes an array of strings to match
// and one or more patterns to use for matching
nanomatch(list, patterns[, options]);
```

**Params**

- `list` **{String|Array}**: One or more strings to match against. This is often a list of files.
- `patterns` **{String|Array}**: One or more [glob paterns](#features) to use for matching.
- `options` **{Object}**: Visit the API to learn about available options.

**Example**

```js
var nm = require('nanomatch');
console.log(nm(['a', 'b/b', 'c/c/c'], '*'));
//=> ['a']

console.log(nm(['a', 'b/b', 'c/c/c'], '*/*'));
//=> ['b/b']

console.log(nm(['a', 'b/b', 'c/c/c'], '**'));
//=> ['a', 'b/b', 'c/c/c']
```

## Features

Nanomatch has full support for standard Bash glob features, including the following "metacharacters": `*`, `**`, `?` and `[...]`.

### Globbing reference

Here are some examples of how they work:

| **Pattern** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `*`         | Matches any string except for `/`, leading `.`, or `/.` inside a path  |
| `**`        | Matches any string including `/`, but not a leading `.` or `/.` inside a path. More than two stars (e.g. `***` is treated the same as one star, and `**` loses its special meaning | when it's not the only thing in a path segment, per Bash specifications) |
| `foo*`      | Matches any string beginning with `foo` |
| `*bar*`     | Matches any string containing `bar` (beginning, middle or end) |
| `*.min.js`  | Matches any string ending with `.min.js` |
| `[abc]*.js` | Matches any string beginning with `a`, `b`, or `c` and ending with `.js` |
| `abc?`      | Matches `abcd` or `abcz` but not `abcde` |

The exceptions noted for `*` apply to all patterns that contain a `*`.

**Not supported**

The following extended-globbing features are not supported:

- [brace expansion][braces] (e.g. `{a,b,c}`)
- [extglobs][extglob] (e.g. `@(a|!(c|d))`)
- [POSIX brackets][brackets] (e.g. `[[:alpha:][:digit:]]`)

If you need any of these features consider using [micromatch][] instead.

### Bash pattern matching

Nanomatch is part of a suite of libraries aimed at bringing the power and expressiveness of [Bash's][] matching and expansion capabilities to JavaScript, _and - as you can see by the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) - without sacrificing speed_.

| **Related library** | **Matching Type** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nanomatch` (you are here) | Wildcards  | `*`           | [Filename expansion][bash-globs], also referred to as globbing and pathname expansion, allows the use of [wildcards](#features) for matching.  |
| [expand-tilde][]     | Tildes     | `~`           | [Tilde expansion][bash-tilde] converts the leading tilde in a file path to the user home directory. |
| [braces][]           | Braces     | `{a,b,c}`     | [Brace expansion][bash-braces] |
| [expand-brackets][]  | Brackets   | `[[:alpha:]]` | [POSIX character classes][bash-brackets] (also referred to as POSIX brackets, or POSIX character classes) |
| [extglob][]          | Parens     | `!(a|b)`      | [Extglobs][bash-extglobs] |
| [micromatch][]       | All        | all           | Micromatch is built on top of the other libraries. |

There are many resources available on the web if you want to dive deeper into how these features work in Bash.
