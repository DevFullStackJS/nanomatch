## What is nanomatch?

Nanomatch is a minimal glob matching library, implemented in JavaScript. This library offers complete support for basic Bash globs, but does not support any "extended globbing" features. If you need to use [brace expansion][braces], [extglobs][extglob], or [POSIX brackets][brackets], consider using [micromatch][] instead.

**What is "glob matching"?**

Similar in concept to [regular expressions][regex], the term "glob" refers to a set of features from [Bash][bash] used for matching or "expanding" certain types of patterns. See the [features](#features) section for examples.

**Heads up!**

Nanomatch does not read from the file system, you will need a library like [node-glob][] for that, or you can use Node's `fs` module to read in the files yourself, then use this library for matching. 

## Features

Nanomatch has full support for basic Bash glob features, including the following:

**Pattern** | **Description**
--- | ---
`*`         | Matches any string except for `/`, leading `.`, or `/.` inside a path 
`**`        | Matches any string including `/`, but not a leading `.` or `/.` inside a path. More than two stars (e.g. `***` is treated the same as one star, per Bash specifications)
`foo*`      | Matches any string beginning with `foo`
`*bar*`     | Matches any string containing `bar` (beginning, middle or end)
`*.min.js`  | Matches any string ending with `.min.js`
`[abc]*.js` | Matches any string beginning with `a`, `b`, or `c` and ending with `.js`
`abc?`      | Matches `abcd` or `abcz` but not `abcde`

The exceptions noted for `*` apply to all patterns that contain a `*`.

**Not supported**

The following extended-globbing features are not supported:

- [brace expansion][braces]
- [extglobs][extglob]
- [POSIX brackets][brackets]

If you need these features, consider using [micromatch][] instead.

var nanomatch = require('{%= name %}');
